### Overview
*The Problem:* Around the UH Campus, thousands of students struggle with student loans and/or are in need of some quick cash. Full or part-time jobs can be difficult to maintain, and therefore students need an alternative form of income.

*The Solution:* Kekoa's List aims to provide students a way to earn quick income by completing tasks around campus and allows the job posters a way to complete odd jobs quickly. 

### Approach
Every user would have a profile associated with their UHM ID that allows them to accept and place jobs on the public job board. 

The job board behaves on a first-come first-served basis. Each listing on the job board would contain a short description along with the pay amount associated with the task. 

A user would then be able to pull a job from the job board, saving it to their profile.

Mockup pages include:
 * Open Board (lists available jobs, time of posting, deadline, offered pay)
 * Accept Job (users take a job from the board, add to their own list)
 * List Jobs (lists the jobs the users have applied for and have been accepted for, lists basic info for each job such as pay, deadline, and means to connect to creator of the job)
 * Accept/Decline Offer (user can accept or decline another user's offer to do their job)
 
### Use case ideas
 * New user creates account, can search job board for appropriate listings. 
 * Job posting user goes to landing page and creates a new job for the job board, listing the appropriate details.
 * Users verify they completed a task and payments received from job poster.
 
### Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
 * Rating system for users in terms of reliability and job satisfaction.
 * See previous job completion history
 * Suggest other users for job
 * Push notifications
 * Venmo/Apple Pay support
