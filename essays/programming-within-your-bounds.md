In a professional environment, strict coding standards can make a world of difference in shipping a polished product. With my time as a budding software engineer, I found working in teams to be the only possible way of completing projects. Tools like Github are critical to ensuring team members can collaborate productively and not waste time solving merging errors. This results in many team members contributing to a single project, often times editing the same file. In this vein, it becomes important to maintain readable and professional levels of code so all team members can be productive as possible. This begets the beginning of coding standards in the workplace.

If there were no coding standards, maintaining a valid repo of source code would become very messy. Curly braces on the same line of the function, spaces vs. tabs, and spaces between curly braces and function definitions are just a few of the differences that occur in a programmer's coding style. I believe as long as the programmer is consistent within their own work, coding standards when working alone are not as important. However, when working with a team, coding standards are crucial. If there were no coding standards, team members could become frustrated and waste time reading an unfamiliar syntax.

By introducing coding standards, programs like ESLint can improve the readability of the source code and hopefully teach the programmer a thing or to. Within the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), Javascript has become easier to read and maintain. By using ESLint in this situation, ESLint can help guide the programmer in learning new syntax for ES6. This makes the transition from ES5 to ES6 simpler and easier. Coding standards are the road lines that help create a drivable highway.
