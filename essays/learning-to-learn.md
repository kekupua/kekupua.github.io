Learning is a life-long endeavor that challenges us to think differently. Wandering off the familiar path into unknown concepts can be a disconcerting task for many. Over the course my life, I have been faced with challenging obstacles and tasks, especially in engineering. It is critical that I ask the proper questions in engineering if I want to learn. Sure, I could search the exact textbook question for online solutions but that doesn't help me grow as a student and engineer.

In the question linked below, an engineer asks about how to prevent a common online security breach known as SQL Injection. SQL Injection allows the attacking party to run scripts natively and directly modify the company's database. To ensure the highest chance for community contribution, the user's question is concise, shows adequate knowledge of the topic, and provides further reference to the topic. This question closely follows the guidelines set by Eric Steven Raymond on writing "Smart" questions. As a result, the top rated answer provides two distinct methods of defense, alongside implementations and explanations on how they work. By working as a community, problems like these can be encountered and quickly dealt with.

On the flip side, there are developers who never learn how to ask the right questions. In the question linked below, a developer asks why a certain font doesn't work with Windows 7. However, by glancing at the title, it is unclear what the problem is. According to Raymond, poor grammar in the title of a question is a deterrent for potential answerers. Furthermore, this question fails to include any context such as the purpose of the project or what steps they have done to try and remedy the problem.

Asking the right questions can mean the difference between success and stagnation. In the "Smart" question, the developer receives the answer he was searching for and can use his newfound knowledge to improve his work. Contrarily, the poor question will most likely remain unanswered and the developer will remain confused. By asking smarter questions, we can lessen the time spent on blockers and be more productive.
