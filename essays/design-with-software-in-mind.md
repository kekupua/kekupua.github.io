## Design for the User
Any good product focuses on two points of contention, functionality and design. Functionality allows your product have to purpose and design allows your product to be used. The design of a product can make a it either a joy or pain to use. In software engineering, the design of the software should be composed for a user-first experience. For example, if I were creating a website for shopping, it would make sense to design the product pages to highlight a purchase button. This drives sales and makes the consumer more likely to purchase their items. Inevitably, certain design patterns arise from common scenarios like these. 

## Fixing Problems Before They Arise
In my limited role as a software engineer, certain application design patterns have arose. For example, in any of the meteor or react applications that we wrote, all of our applications had a navigational bar at the top of the page. This is a common design practice around the web because it allows the user to quickly navigate the site at any point in time by just scrolling to the top of the page. Another example is less for the user but more for the developer. In our Github commit messages, I always make a note to create commit messages that read as action phrases. Phrases such as "Implemented navbar" or "Fixed bug with QuestID loading" are more helpful to other developers than "navabar" or "bug QuestID". Overall, the design patterns in our development for software help to elucidate the use cases of our program. With a good design, any product can be boosted to be more useful and practical than one with a poor design.
