#### What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

#### What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

Javascript, the internet's universal language. Prior to beginning my enrollment in ICS 314, I had prior history working with Javascript in a few jobs. All of the jobs included some form of web component as a deliverable. Prior to working those jobs however, Javascript seemed like a foreign concept. "What is Javascript?", I asked myself. I had heard previously of Java as a tool for Minecraft modding but nothing of Javascript. After I began working with and learning Javascript, I began to see the ease of use and practicality in the language. Adding functionality to a web page or running simple offline scripts proved to be an interesting and challenging process. Javascript has been and will continue to be a critical tool in web development. As such, I believe it is a necessity to learn.    

Compared to other languages that I have experience with, such as Python and C/C++, I find Javascript to be simple, yet rewarding. The simplicity of type definitions in Javascript make it ill-suited for what may be larger scale, Object-Oriented projects that C++ could tackle, but it is still a robust language capable of handily completing tasks. Javascript continues to develop as a language and will only improve as functions are agreed upon.

The Workout of the Day or WOD, has been a great way to introduce new topics to students. Doing a problem or two a day in Javascript can really ease the anxiety felt when approaching a blank text window and question. Having undergone several interviews at software engineering companies, I can attest to the nervousness felt when timed on a technical interview. Within a hour or so window, you are expected to solve an unfamiliar question using software engineering principles. Doing the WODs simulates this environment and helps solidify the skills you need to perform.
