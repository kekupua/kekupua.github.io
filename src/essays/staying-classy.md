When the web was first invented, there was an inherent desire to share information. Transmitting data across the globe became possible in minutes rather than days. As technology has improved, so has our ability to distribute information and knowledge. Beginning with just HTML, the first websites were brass and mainly used by governments. The introduction of CSS allowed for styling and the introduction of Javascript allowed for functionality. These three languages have seen their fair share of improvements over time and thus begins the era of UI frameworks.

Semantic UI is one of many UI frameworks aimed at making web development simpler and faster. Essentially, Semantic UI acts as a series of applicable class names that provide functionality to an element. For example, the "ui container" class creates a div with margins on both sides of it to give the div a focused look. This makes styling a web page much quicker as this is two class appends versus having to edit a css file to add margin on both sides of a given div.

Using Semantic UI allows for the quick building of webpages. What may have taken hours to write can now take minutes. UI frameworks simplify the building of webpages by obfuscating the gritty deals of css. A class name such a "ui container" is much easier to remember and write than the actual css. Thankfully, there exists alternatives to Semantic as well if Semantic doesn't appeal to your development tastes. Frameworks like AngularJS, Bootstrap, React, and Vue, are just a few of the popular frameworks for front-end development. Applying any of these frameworks to your website can make it more robust and easier to maintain.
